                <li>I have learned today about Emmet. Cool thing, when I will learn how to use it. I guess I will get used to that 
                    after a while, but now it seems easy, although still requiers quite some thinking to write it right. Will start 
                    with small commands, and will expand the skill of them in time. </li>
